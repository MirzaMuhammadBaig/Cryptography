#### What is Cryptography?
```
Cryptography is the science of using mathematics to encrypt and decrypt data.
```

#### Types of Cryptography
```
Symmetric key Cryptography:

In this method similar key is used for encrypting and decrypting. This method is not good.

Simple as that: If A send message to B. A will encrpyt message from any key then B decrypt that message with that key which key used for encryption. And A will have to send that key with message.
```
```
Asymmetric key Cryptography:

In this method pair of private and public key is used for encrypting and decrypting. This method is very good.

Simple as that: If A send message to B. A will encrpyt message from B's public key then B decrypt that message from own private key. And A will not have to send any key with message.
